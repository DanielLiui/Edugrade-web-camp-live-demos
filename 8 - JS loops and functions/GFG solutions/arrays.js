function log(data) { console.log(data) }


/*
Steps:
1. Write input and output examples. Try to cover all cases.

2. Mentally map a basic solution and code. Do not make function too long, use custom 
functions to lay out your algorithm then implement custom functions or ask GPT to 
code them

3. Check solution and test. Print different steps of the code to see what is 
going on. It will help find where errors are and what is causing them.

Starting testing the custom functions you wrote.

4. Keep testing until code is good
