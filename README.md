## Downloading folders
On Github, you can only download the root folder containing all the subfolders. 
To download specific folders, follow these steps:

1. Click on folder you want to download
2. Go to this online github folder downloader: https://download-directory.github.io/
3. Insert the link to the github folder you want to download and press enter.
   A zip folder will be installed. Unzip that folder and you are good to go.
